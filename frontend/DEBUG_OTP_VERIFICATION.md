# 🔍 Debugging OTP Verification (400 Error)

## What I Added

I've added comprehensive logging to help identify why the OTP verification is failing.

## 📊 Check Your Console

After trying to verify OTP, check your **browser console** (F12) and **terminal** for these logs:

### Browser Console (F12):
```
🔐 Attempting to verify OTP: 123456
📤 Sending verification request for email: test@example.com
📥 Verification response: {...}
```

### Terminal (Server):
```
📥 Verify OTP request: { email: '...', otp: '...' }
🔍 Verifying OTP for test@example.com
📝 Received OTP: "123456" (length: 6)
💾 Stored data: OTP: "123456", Expires: ...
🔐 Comparing: received="123456" vs stored="123456"
✅ OTP verified successfully!
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "OTP not found"
**Logs show:** `💾 Stored data: Not found`

**Cause:** OTP was never generated or already used

**Solution:**
1. Request a new OTP
2. Check that the email used is exactly the same

---

### Issue 2: "OTP expired"
**Logs show:** `❌ OTP expired`

**Cause:** More than 10 minutes passed since OTP generation

**Solution:** Request a new OTP

---

### Issue 3: "Invalid OTP"
**Logs show:** `❌ OTP mismatch`
```
🔐 Comparing: received="123456" vs stored="654321"
```

**Cause:** Wrong OTP entered

**Solution:**
1. Check the OTP in the terminal where it was generated
2. Make sure you're entering all 6 digits correctly
3. The OTP is case-sensitive and must be exact

---

### Issue 4: "Invalid OTP format"
**Logs show:** `❌ Invalid OTP format: ... Type: ...`

**Cause:** OTP contains non-digit characters or wrong length

**Solution:**
1. Only enter numbers (0-9)
2. Must be exactly 6 digits
3. No spaces or special characters

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Debug

1. **Generate OTP:**
   - Enter email and click "Continue"
   - Check terminal for: `📧 OTP for email@example.com: 123456`
   - **Copy this exact OTP**

2. **Enter OTP:**
   - Type the 6 digits from terminal
   - Check browser console for: `🔐 Attempting to verify OTP: ...`

3. **Check Verification:**
   - Terminal should show comparison
   - If they don't match, check for typos

4. **Check Response:**
   - Browser console shows response
   - Terminal shows verification result

## 📋 What to Share If Still Failing

Copy and share these logs:

**From Browser Console:**
```
🔐 Attempting to verify OTP: [YOUR OTP]
📤 Sending verification request for email: [YOUR EMAIL]
📥 Verification response: [RESPONSE]
```

**From Terminal:**
```
📥 Verify OTP request: ...
🔍 Verifying OTP for ...
📝 Received OTP: ...
💾 Stored data: ...
🔐 Comparing: ...
```

## 💡 Quick Test

Try this simple test:

1. Open app, enter email: `test@example.com`
2. Click "Continue"
3. Terminal shows: `📧 OTP for test@example.com: 123456`
4. Enter OTP: `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6`
5. Click "Verify OTP"
6. Should succeed! ✅

If this doesn't work, the logs will tell us exactly why!
